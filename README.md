# DAT505-2026
Course materials, datasets, and R scripts for DAT505 - Winter 2026


### Course description

The main objective of this course is to equip students with a comprehensive set of skills for conducting research in experimental psychology and the behavioral sciences. These skills extend beyond the acquisition of technical tools and are best understood as a way of thinking critically about data and scientific questions. On the technical side, the course develops proficiency in programming with R, as well as mastery of both basic and advanced statistical methods commonly used in behavioral research. However, equal emphasis is placed on non-technical competencies that are essential to sound data analysis. Students will learn how to formulate clear research questions, critically select methods, properly interpret statistical results, and communicate findings to both technical and non-technical audiences. To achieve these learning objectives, the course relies on a project-based pedagogy, through which students will produce two full research reports using real datasets from existing behavioral research.

### By the end of the course, students will be able to:
Programming and data management
•	Use R and RStudio at an advanced level for data cleaning, transformation and analysis.
Statistical methods
•	Apply and interpret core statistical tools used in behavioral research, including hypothesis testing, linear and generalized linear models.
Data visualization
•	Create informative data visualizations for exploratory analysis and communication of results.
Analytical and research skills
•	Formulate research questions with clear, testable hypotheses.
•	Operationalize theoretical constructs using appropriate measures.
•	Select and justify analytical methods suited to the research question and data structure.
•	Critically interpret statistical results.
Communication and reporting
•	Communicate results effectively in oral presentations.
•	Produce reproducible research reports using R Markdown and Quarto.
•	(Optional) Develop interactive data visualizations and applications using Shiny.
Workflow and collaboration
•	Use version control with Git and GitHub.
Reproducible research and transparency
•	Write fully reproducible code.
•	Understand and apply core open science practices, including pre-registration.
